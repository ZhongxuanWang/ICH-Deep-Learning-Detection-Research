# Code folder

There are two folders in this code folder, *Local* and *Server*, since as the process progresses, two different versions of code diverged.

**Local** was more generic, containing codes that are initially written for general purposes.

**Server** was more divergent, containing codes that are from different versions, and all models were trained using code from this folder.
